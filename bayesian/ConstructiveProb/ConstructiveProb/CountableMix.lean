# Countable mixtures: Kleisli composition on countable data, with no space structure

The hard problem flagged in the paper's conclusion is that a probability *monad* for our
valuations needs the space of valuations to be an object of some category, and the known
presentations of that space use Scott continuity essentially.  The modern strategy around the
neighboring Jung–Tix obstructions is to carve out a well-behaved *fragment*: quasi-Borel
spaces on the measure-theoretic side, minimal/central valuation submonads on DCPO
(Jia–Lindenhovius–Mislove–Zamdzhiev, LICS 2021).

This file is the first formal step of that strategy in our discontinuous setting.  A
*countable mixture* of valuations is again a valuation (`Valuation.mixCountable`), and
mixtures of mixtures flatten to mixtures with product weights
(`Valuation.mixCountable_mixCountable`), with the unit index behaving as an identity
(`Valuation.mixCountable_unique`).  These are exactly the monad-multiplication and unit laws
*at the level of presented countable data*: composing countably-supported statistical kernels
needs no topology on the space of valuations, because `ℝ≥0∞`-sums are unconditionally
defined, commute with addition, and satisfy Fubini over sigma types.

What this does and does not show, stated carefully.  It shows that the countably-presented
fragment supports associative, unital kernel composition, machine-checked.  It does not
construct a monad: the presentations (weight functions on index types) are not canonical, and
we do not here quotient by "presents the same valuation."  The diffuse part of the
decomposition (`tsum_mass_le` in `RepresentationGeneral.lean`) is precisely what escapes all
countable presentations, so the obstruction identified in the paper is untouched, and
deliberately so.

/-- **A countable mixture of valuations is a valuation.**  For weights `w : ι → ℝ≥0∞` with
`∑' i, w i = 1` and valuations `v i`, the assignment `a ↦ ∑' i, w i * v i a` is a valuation.
Every axiom is inherited termwise, because `ℝ≥0∞`-sums commute with addition and preserve
order.  (The index type is arbitrary, but a weight function summing to `1` has countable
support, so this is the countably-atomic fragment.) -/
