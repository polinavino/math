# The halting valuation — a computability guard against classical collapse

This file builds the **intended non-classical model** of the theory: a valuation on the
value-chain `ℝ≥0∞` on which a distinguished *semi-decidable* proposition (morally "machine `n`
halts") receives a probability strictly between `0` and `1`, with positive slack.

The picture. A semi-decidable (`Σ₁`) proposition is an *open* in the Sierpiński/observational
topology: it can be confirmed by a finite computation but never refuted by one. Its
pseudo-complement is the interior of its set-complement, which for a genuinely undecidable
statement is `⊥` — you cannot even partially refute it. So on the three-element Sierpiński frame
`⊥ < h < ⊤` (the opens of Sierpiński space), the "halts" element `h` has `hᶜ = ⊥`. Assigning it
the halting probability `p ∈ (0,1)` — morally Chaitin's `Ω = Σ_{p halts} 2^{-|p|}`, a specific
uncomputable, Martin-Löf-random real — gives `v h + v hᶜ = p + 0 = p < 1`: genuine slack
`1 - p`, the measure of the undecidable region.

Why this matters for the axioms. The whole design constraint on a constructive Cox theorem is
that the axioms *guarantee* the representation result without *collapsing* to classical logic
(which would force `v a + v aᶜ = 1`, i.e. slack `≡ 0`). This model is a witness that the theory
stays constructive: any axiom set strong enough to force classical collapse is **refuted** by
the halting valuation, because computability theory forbids `p ∈ {0,1}`. It plays the role for
the sum rule that `nonempty_coxModel` plays for the product rule — a vacuity/collapse guard.

We realize the Sierpiński frame concretely as the sub-chain `{⊥, h, ⊤} ⊆ ℝ≥0∞` (taking
`h = 1`); on a complete chain modularity is automatic, so the construction is light.

`Sierpinski.lean` upgrades every "morally" above to a theorem: the frame becomes the honest
`Opens Prop`, the valuation comes from a real measure through the GMT bridge
(`slack = μ(∂A)` computed end-to-end), and the guard is grounded in `Nat.Partrec.Code` —
deciding the sharp classical readout *is* the halting problem (`sharpReadout_not_computable`).

"halts") with probability strictly in `(0,1)` and positive slack — the signature of genuinely
constructive, non-classical probability. Any axiom set forcing classical collapse (`slack ≡ 0`,
equivalently `v h + v hᶜ = 1`) is refuted by this model, since computability forbids `p ∈ {0,1}`.
