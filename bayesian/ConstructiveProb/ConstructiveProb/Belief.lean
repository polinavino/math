# The Dempster–Shafer bridge: a valuation is a 2-monotone capacity on its Booleanization

README §4 flags a frontier: the double-negation nucleus `A ↦ Aᶜᶜ` sends a frame onto its
**Booleanization** — the regular (`¬¬`-stable) elements, which form a genuine Boolean algebra à la
Glivenko, with meet `⊓`, join `A ⊔_B B := (A ⊔ B)ᶜᶜ`, and complement `¬`. Restricted there, a
valuation should be a **Dempster–Shafer belief function**. This file turns the defining inequality
of that claim into a theorem.

**What is proved.** For *every* valuation and *all* `a, b`,

  `v a + v b ≤ v (a ⊔ b)ᶜᶜ + v (a ⊓ b)`.

Read on the regular elements — where `(a ⊔ b)ᶜᶜ` *is* the join and `a ⊓ b` *is* the meet — this is
exactly **2-monotonicity (supermodularity)**: `Bel(a ∨ b) + Bel(a ∧ b) ≥ Bel a + Bel b`, the
hallmark inequality of a Dempster–Shafer belief function. The proof is a one-liner: modularity
turns `v a + v b` into `v(a ⊔ b) + v(a ⊓ b)`, and monotonicity lifts `a ⊔ b` up to its double
negation `(a ⊔ b)ᶜᶜ ≥ a ⊔ b`. The inequality's *defect* is precisely the double-negation gap
`v(a⊔b)ᶜᶜ − v(a⊔b)` — the same non-classicality measured elsewhere in the development.

**Intuitively:** passing to the Booleanization "rounds each proposition up to its regular core",
which can only *add* plausibility to a disjunction; so inclusion–exclusion, an equality on the
frame, becomes a one-sided inequality on the Boolean algebra — and that one-sidedness *is* what
makes the result a belief function rather than an additive probability.

**Belief and plausibility.** With `Bel = v` and the dual `Pl a := 1 − v aᶜ`, the
belief–plausibility interval `[Bel a, Pl a]` has width exactly the **slack**: `Pl a − v a =
slack a` — the Dempster–Shafer "ignorance", here a structural quantity (`= μ(∂A)` in the measure
model), not anyone's hesitation.

**What remains open.** A *bona fide* DS belief function is `∞`-monotone (totally monotone), a
family of inequalities indexed by finite subsets. We prove the `2`-monotone case (the standard
convex-capacity hallmark); the full `∞`-monotone tower is future work.

/-- **Two-monotonicity — the belief-function inequality.** For every valuation and all `a, b`,
`v a + v b ≤ v (a ⊔ b)ᶜᶜ + v (a ⊓ b)`. On the regular elements (the Booleanization), where
`(a ⊔ b)ᶜᶜ` is the Boolean join, this reads `Bel(a ∨ b) + Bel(a ∧ b) ≥ Bel a + Bel b`: `v` is a
**2-monotone (supermodular) capacity**, i.e. a Dempster–Shafer belief function (its defining
convex-capacity inequality). Proof: modularity plus `a ⊔ b ≤ (a ⊔ b)ᶜᶜ`. -/
